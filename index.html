      <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>
      <a class="social-link" href="http://twitter.com/mhartl">here</a>
      <p>
        Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivaled humility,
        Michael is the creator of the
        <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails
        Tutorial</a> and principal author of the
        <a href="https://learnenough.com/">
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. Michael
        is also notorious as the founder of
        <a href="http://tauday.com/">Tau Day</a> and author of
        <a href="http://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em>The Tau
        Manifesto</em></a>, but rumors that he's secretly a supervillain
        are slightly exaggerated.

      <p>
        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on
        his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
        interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
        interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

      <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>
      <a class="social-link" href="https://twitter.com/nickmerwin">here</a>
      <p>
        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
        Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at
        heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour
        bus as he is from his kitchen table.
